# Task 8: Working with VPNs

## üéØ Objective
To explore how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect user privacy by encrypting internet traffic and masking IP addresses. This task involved setting up a VPN, connecting to a server, and verifying changes in IP and browsing behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **VPN Provider**: Windscribe (Free Tier)
- **Test Website**: [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
- **Operating System**: Windows 11

## üîß Steps Performed

1. Signed up for a free Windscribe VPN account.
2. Downloaded and installed the Windscribe desktop client.
3. Logged in and connected to the **Atlanta ‚Äì Mountain** free VPN server.
4. Verified IP address before connecting to VPN:
   - **Location**: Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India
   - **IP Address**: 122.168.60.139
5. After connecting, checked IP again:
   - **New Location**: Atlanta, United States
   - Confirmed successful change in IP and location.
6. Browsed websites to confirm encryption and secure tunneling.
7. Disconnected the VPN and compared internet speed and routing changes.

## üß† What I Learned

- A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic and hides your real IP address by routing it through a remote server.
- VPNs use protocols like **OpenVPN**, **IKEv2**, and **WireGuard** to secure the tunnel.
- Free VPNs like Windscribe offer basic privacy features but may have bandwidth or location limits.
- VPNs:
  - Help avoid ISP tracking
  - Protect data on public Wi-Fi
  - Do **not** guarantee full anonymity
- Network speed may drop slightly depending on server distance and load.
